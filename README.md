# alx_project_2

## Overview
This Project is part of the core requirements for the ALX-Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Program.
The aim of the project is to practice the three wrangling steps: Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning.

## Gathering
Three datasets were used for the project
- The first dataset was directly downloaded from the Udacity Classroom. It contains data on tweets about dogs and their ratings.
- The second was scraped off a [website](' https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv'). It contained data on predictions of dog breed from their images.
- The third dataset is a json text from Twitter API showing a record of tweets about dogs and other features like retweet_count and favourite_count.

## Assessment and Cleaning
After thorough visual and programmatic assessment, eight quality issues and two tidiness issues were detected and cleaned appropriately. Then, the datasets were joined and stored for visualization

## Key Insights From Visualization
